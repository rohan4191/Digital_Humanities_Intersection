# The Intersection Between the Digital and the Humanities

Academia has long established a distinction between different departments. While some inter-department collaboration may occur between more humanities-focused departments or between more science-focused departments, there is little intermingling between computer science and the humanities. This project seeks to establish why there is and should be greater overlap between the digital and the humanities. Referencing Tara McPherson’s “Why Are the Digital Humanities So White," Kim Gallon’s “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities," and Justin Grimmer's “We Are All Social Scientists Now," we make a case for how the digital and the humanities have always been intermixed, and how this overlap needs to be more recognized and more explored. Since the creation of Unix, computer science has been closely entangled with social justice. Operating systems were being created at the same time as the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Panthers, and the Young Lords were beginning their fight against social injustice. In more modern times, we see digital humanities works featuring race, culture, and ethnicity becoming more and more prominent. However, discussion of the history behind black studies in the digital humanites is still sorely lacking. This intersectional field needs to be more deeply explored as a restorative process. Finally, all this new data spawned by advances in computer science inevitably require skills from the social sciences to effectively analyze and draw conclusions.
